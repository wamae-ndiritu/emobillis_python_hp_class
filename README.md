# Python Fundamentals

### Variables

We explore variable definition and declaration.
![variables](./variables.py)

### Keywords

We look at the different reserved words that are found in python.
![keywords](./keywords.py)

### Data Types

To explore the different data types we came across ![click here](./datatypes.py)

### Data Structures

#### List

![List](./lists.py) and [list as arrays](./arrays.py)

Lists are ordered collections of items

```
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

```

#### Dictionaries

![dictionaries](./dictionaries.py)
Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and it is used to access the corresponding value. Dictionaries are mutable.

```
my_dict = {"name": "Ndiritu", "age": 20}
```

#### Other Data structures

- Sets
- Tuples

### If else conditions

![conditional statements](./if_else.py)
They allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to `True` or `False`

### Loops

#### For Loops

![for loops](./for_loop.py)

`for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each element in the sequence.

#### While loops

![while loops](./while_loop.py)

A `while` loop in programming is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is True.
